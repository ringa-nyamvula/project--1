# Phase One Project 
## Description
In this project i decided to work with a meal public API and used different mealrecipes and ingridients from their json data.

The page basically shows one the various recipe and allows oneto like and the recipe if they are pleased.It also has a comment section where any comments be it criticism or compliments could be shared and looked at.

## Approach
The project is mainly in java script and html and css.
